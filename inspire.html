        <p>Ever since i was a little kid i grew up watching baseball. When i started to understand baseball a more and more i always loved watching one specific person in perticular and that was Mike Trout. Mike Trout is a professional baseball player who plays for the Los Angeles Angels. He inspires me not only in baseball but life in general. The way he inspires me is he helps outt his community in any way he can and he gives back to the people he loves most. Playing baseball i try to copy my skill off of what he does like swinging, throwing, playing hard, and being mature. </p>
